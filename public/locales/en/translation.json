Non-combustible, does not support combustion, 1.5 times heavier than air, dissolves well in water, forming CO. The boiling point is -78.3°C. Various properties of carbon dioxide are used in industry. In the food industry, CO2 is used for freezing, storage and acid control, for carbonation beverages. In the chemical industry to control the acidity of water. Carbon dioxide is also used to weld metals as a protective gas to stimulate plant growth in the greenhouse."

The main uses of oxygen are based on its burning and life-sustaining properties. Oxygen is widely used as a combustible gas in smelters, for firing, for welding and cutting metals. In the chemical industry, oxygen is used as a raw material, in paper - as a bleaching agent. In medicine, oxygen is widely used for patient support and oxygen therapy."
